This web map was created as a tourism guide or visual aid for an article produced by Touropia.com. It uses a combination of choropleth and point symbology to highlight the most popular destinations as decided by travelers who use Tripadvisor. The map also helps to show which provinces are most well liked by travelers. The shapefile for Panamaâ€™s provinces was acquired from The Humanitarian Data Exchange. It was converted to a .Geojson within QGIS. The top destinations for each province were collected from Tripadvisor.com. These destinations where then manually put into an Excel spreadsheet by me. The spreadsheet was then converted to a .CSV and then converted again to a .Geojson. Another spreadsheet was created where the average rating (out of 5 stars) for all destinations were calculated for each province. This spreadsheet was then joined to the provinces shapefile to create the choropleth portion of the map. The base map was acquired from CartoDB and custom point symbology was taken from FontAwesome.
